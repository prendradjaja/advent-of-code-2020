# DISCRETE LOGARITHM (log in modular arithmetic)
# calculator: https://www.alpertron.com.ar/DILOG.HTM
# more about the concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm#Modular_arithmetic
#
# How to use the calculator to get the answer:
# base = 7 (sn)
# power = 16616892 (cpub)
# modulus = 20201227
# Find exp such that 7exp â‰¡ 16 616892 (mod 20 201227)
# exp = **16 243648** + 20 201226k
# x = the starred part
# foo(dpub, x) is the answer

def main():
    print(foo(dpub, 16_243648))  # See explanation above
    return

    # Brute force approach. This should be correct, but should take too long.

    # for i in itertools.count(start=0):
    #     tryc = foo(7, i)
    #     tryd = foo(7, i)
    #     if tryc == cpub:
    #         print(i)
    #         print(foo(dpub, i))
    #         return
    #     if tryd == dpub:
    #         print(i)
    #         print(foo(cpub, i))
    #         return
